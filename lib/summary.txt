Step 1: Create the project under the name "Amazon Clone". Then we created the themes class named 'Constant'
and stored in the constants.dart file. The constant class is used to store the colors of the different
components of the app.
Step 2: We then created the signIn/ signUp page of the app. Created the UI and added the color from the
constant.dart file.
Step 3: Then , we organised the structure of the application by create directories for the
different pages and tools for the app. We then create a new file named 'routes.dart' and stored the routes
of the different pages in it.
Step 4: In routes.dart, we created a dynamic Route function named 'generateRoute' which takes
in a RouteSettings object and return a MaterialPageRoute object only when the RouterSettings passed as an
argument in the function matches the switch-case condition. Also, added the onGenerateRoute property to
the MaterialApp widget and passed the context as setting from the Router Settings.
Step 5: Then the UI portion , which included the
TextFormField Buttons and Radio Button was created. The TextFormField was created in a separate common
file named 'custom_textfield.dart' and stored in common/widgets directory. Same was done for the
Custom Elevated Button. A new "Enum" was also created which contain the singIn and signUp.
Step 6: Now, we created the Server directory which contain index.js file. Nodemon and Express was
installed and using Node Package Manager (NPM).
